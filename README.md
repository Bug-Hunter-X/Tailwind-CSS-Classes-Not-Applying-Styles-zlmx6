# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly, even with seemingly correct configuration.

## Problem
The `bug.html` file contains HTML elements with Tailwind CSS classes.  However, the classes fail to apply any styling. This occurs even after verifying the Tailwind configuration, imports, and class names for typos.  Standard debugging steps such as restarting the development server prove ineffective.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file provides a solution by addressing a potential issue: incorrect ordering of CSS imports or conflicts with other stylesheets that may override Tailwind's styles.
