I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my components.  The HTML elements seemed to ignore the classes, resulting in no styling changes. My Tailwind configuration file appeared to be correct, and I had imported it properly.  I tried restarting the development server and checking for typos in the class names, but the problem persisted.
